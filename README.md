# 🏥 Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Introduction
The **Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based web application that helps users predict the likelihood of diseases such as **Diabetes, Parkinson’s, and Heart Disease** based on input health parameters. The system processes user data, applies a trained ML model, and provides predictions to assist in early diagnosis.

## ✨ Features
✅ User-friendly **web interface** built using Streamlit  
✅ Supports prediction of **Diabetes, Parkinson’s, and Heart Disease**  
✅ Uses **Scikit-learn models** for machine learning  
✅ **Real-time results** based on user input  
✅ **Data preprocessing & feature selection** for accurate predictions  
✅ Deployable on **Heroku / PythonAnywhere / AWS**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - NumPy & Pandas – Data Processing 📊
  - Scikit-learn – Machine Learning 🤖
  - Streamlit – Web Application 🌐
- **Deployment:** Heroku / PythonAnywhere / Local Server ☁️

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jigyasukhera/prediction-of-diseases.git
cd prediction-of-diseases
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run web.py
```

## 🎯 Usage
1️⃣ Open the web app in your browser.  
2️⃣ Enter the required health parameters.  
3️⃣ Click the **Predict** button to see the results.  
4️⃣ The model will display whether the user is at risk for any of the diseases.  

## 📚 Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available medical datasets from **Kaggle**.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add more diseases for prediction.  
🔹 Improve model accuracy with deep learning techniques.  
🔹 Deploy as a **mobile app** for better accessibility.  
🔹 Integrate **real-time patient monitoring** via IoT devices.
